Similarly, Dropout (outside of the attention block) is an operation that is applied on the last embedding dimension. These two layers are independent over the sequence dimension, so they can be processed in blocks on separate GPUs. As can be seen in the following figure, the initial <code>LayerNorm</code> in a multi-headed transformer block is executed in parallel. Next the results are gathered for the self attention and linear layers (which are typically set up for tensor parallelism). Next the result from those layers is scattered back to sequence parallel nodes which execute dropout, do a residual connection from the previous sequence parallel output, and a layernorm. Next those results are again gathered for the final FFN and activation layers prior to a final scattering across sequence parallel GPUs for the output of that transformer block. </p> <p>As a user, if you know that your transformer is executed in parallel and you have custom losses or downstream layers, you need to make sure that the appropriate gather operations are occurring for your loss computation etc.</p>"},{"location":"main/about/background/nemo2/#context-parallelism","title":"Context Parallelism","text":"<p>Context parallelism extends sequence parallelism by also parallelizing the attention mechanism itself, similar to Ring Attention.

Note that the number of virtual GPUs is multiplicative so if you have <code>TP=2</code> and <code>PP=2</code>, then you are creating a larger virtual GPU out of <code>2*2=4</code> GPUs, so your cluster size needs to be a multiple of 4 in this case. </p>"},{"location":"main/about/background/nemo2/#scheduling-model-parallelism","title":"Scheduling Model Parallelism","text":"<p>You can improve on naive schedules by splitting up micro-batches into smaller pieces, executing many stages of the model on single GPUs, and starting computing the backwards pass of one micro-batch while another is going through forward.

Nits and style guide violations tend to overlap, and you shouldn't   have to justify the use of a shared style guide or things like   proper spelling.

Please make sure that the necessary convergence tests and unit tests   have passed and have not regressed. If KPI regression (convergence tests) is found, you may need to   consult with other stakeholders before approving the MR. In some   cases a Cl will require convergence testing. Owners/ Approvers   should make sure convergence testing is performed when necessary and   that no new issues are identified.

In the event that the patch breaks things, you are   expected to be actively involved in the cleanup effort and support   the authors by reverting and speeding the fixes. This means you   shouldn't approve a patch just because you trust the author of a   patch - Make sure you understand what the implications of a patch   might be, or leave the review to others.

Add   reviewers, ask for reviewers on slack or even just rebase it   against the current codebase to bring it to the top of the Gitlab   list. If you're not sure who would be a good reviewer, gitlab will suggest OWNERS based   on the CODEOWNERS file in the UI or look at the   git history of the files that you've changed, and add those   people. For NIM-API based changes there is a small team managing these   therefore seek for those people to review APIs.</p> </li> <li> <p>Try to coordinate with other significant contributors to the code   when making changes to areas you do not own. Before you type a   single line of code!. These people made the most significant   changes to that part of the code and therefore are knowledgeable   of any tradeoffs to be made.

While it may seem   annoying to address a request to fix spelling or 'trivial' issues,   it's generally easy to handle in Gitlab's built-in editor. If you   do use the built-in editor, remember to get that change to your   local copy before re-pushing. It's also acceptable to add fixes   for these sorts of comments to another branch, but it's recommended   that that branch be pushed to Gitlab before the initial branch gets   submitted.</p> </li> <li> <p>Check if there's documentation that needs to be updated to remain   current after your change.

If a change leads to problems with the code,   the focus should be on fixing the issue, not on assigning blame.</p> </li> <li> <p>Be respectful to others when commenting on branches. Comments should   be kept to the code and should be kept in a polite tone. Assume   your colleagues are intelligent and do not intend any malice or   disrespect. Resist the urge to retaliate against perceived verbal   misconduct, such behavior is not conducive to getting branches   merged. Also, avoid absolute and aggressive language as this can   tend to escalate emotions. Comments are meant to be collaborative.   Very often, the commenter might also be incorrect since they may not have   the full story of the patch in mind since they were not the author. A comment   is not a demand, it's a suggestion towards a mutually acceptable solution   between the author and the reviewer.</p> </li> <li> <p>Don't submit code that you know will break other   platforms/dependencies.

For example, do not write \"[topic]   Bugfix\" as your header in the commit message. Keep links to videos   out of the commit message. Again, partners are going to see these   logs and it does not make sense to link to something they will not   have access to view. Keep your commit messages under 72 chars in   length per line. Good commits have an appropriate topic with a   nice one-liner that explains the change briefly. This is then   followed by a few sentences or more on a description of the   change. Be professional in your language and do not put things in   the message that a partner would not understand. Avoid the use of   acronyms, abbreviations, or codenames, especially those meaningful   only at nvidia. Also, use correct English (check your spelling   please).

The way that Arc institute handled this was by setting the <code>--seq-len-interpolation-factor</code> to linearly scale the ROPE embedding for context extension. For example, if the base context length is 8192 and the extended context length is 65536, the factor would be 65536/8192 = 8.

The usage typically consists of the following steps:</p> <ol> <li>Use the <code>collect_cuda_peak_alloc</code> function to collect CUDA peak memory    allocation statistics for a user-defined workflow. It's expected that the    user-defined workflow will return a list of features extracted from the data    so that the memory model in the following step can use these features to    predict the memory allocation.</li> <li>User defines and trains a memory model using the features and memory allocation    data from previous step. This memory model can then be used to predict memory    consumption.</li> <li>Use <code>SizeAwareBatchSampler</code> or <code>size_aware_batching</code> with the memory model    prediction (from the previous step) to build batch of data so that the    resulting mini-batches do not exceed a specified maximum total memory size.</li> </ol> <p>In addition, this package provides one solution to create homogeneous mini-batches, which can be useful to reduce the padding when aligning the shape of inputs when training or evaluating the models. This <code>BucketBatchSampler</code> can be used in conjunction with <code>torch.utils.data.BatchSampler</code>, <code>SizeAwareBatchSampler</code> or other user-defined batch samplers. This usage can leverage the <code>create_buckets</code> function and follow the steps below:</p> <ol> <li>Gather the tensor sizes of elements in the dataset, which are the shapes of    tensors in a specific dimension where you want to reduce the padding.</li> <li>Provide your own bucket boundaries based on the tensor sizes, or create bucket    boundaries with <code>create_buckets</code> function with the tensor sizes and bucket    maximal width and the minimal bucket count. The <code>create_buckets</code> function    will try to create buckets with smallest widths and element counts &gt;= minimal    bucket count, unless the maximal width or the boundary is reached.</li> <li>Use <code>BucketBatchSampler</code> with base batch sampler like <code>torch.utils.data.BatchSampler</code> or    <code>SizeAwareBatchSampler</code> for each bucket. The <code>BucketBatchSampler</code> will select a bucket each time    and generate a mini-batch from this bucket using the base batch sampler for this bucket.    As such, the padding necessary for the generated mini-batches will be always smaller    than the width of buckets.</li> </ol> <p>Refer to the later sections for the API documentation and examples on how to achieve each of the steps above.</p>"},{"location":"main/developer-guide/bionemo-size-aware-batching/bionemo-size-aware-batching-Overview/#utils-module","title":"utils Module","text":"<ul> <li> <p>collect_cuda_peak_alloc: A function that   collects CUDA peak memory allocation statistics and features to be used for   memory usage prediction for a given workflow.</p> </li> <li> <p>create_buckets: A function to create buckets for a   list of integers with pre-defined maximal width of ranges and minimal   bucket sizes.</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"main/developer-guide/bionemo-size-aware-batching/bionemo-size-aware-batching-Overview/#sampler-module","title":"sampler Module","text":"<ul> <li>size_aware_batching: A generator that batches elements from an iterable while   ensuring that the total size of each batch does not exceed a specified maximum.</li> <li>SizeAwareBatchSampler: A class that batches elements of varying sizes while   ensuring that the total size of each batch does not exceed a specified maximum.</li> <li>BucketBatchSampler: A class that groups elements of varying sizes based on predefined   bucket ranges, and create batches with elements from each bucket to ensure that each batch has elements with   homogeneous sizes.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"main/developer-guide/bionemo-size-aware-batching/bionemo-size-aware-batching-Overview/#api-reference-and-examples","title":"API reference and examples","text":""},{"location":"main/developer-guide/bionemo-size-aware-batching/bionemo-size-aware-batching-Overview/#utils","title":"utils","text":""},{"location":"main/developer-guide/bionemo-size-aware-batching/bionemo-size-aware-batching-Overview/#collect_cuda_peak_alloc","title":"collect_cuda_peak_alloc","text":"<pre><code>def collect_cuda_peak_alloc(\n    dataset: Iterable[Data],\n    work: Callable[[Data], Feature],\n    device: torch.device,\n    cleanup: Optional[Callable[[], None]] = None\n) -&gt; Tuple[List[Feature], List[int]]\n</code></pre> <p>Collects CUDA peak memory allocation statistics for a given workflow.</p> <p>This function iterates through the provided dataset, applies the given feature function to each data point, and records the peak CUDA memory allocation during this process.

If you want to infer or score new data, you need FP8 enabled since it was trained that way. Interestingly the <code>7b</code> checkpoint does not suffer from this limitation and seems robust to FP8 being activated or not. The consequence of this is that if you have older GPUs with a compute capability less than 8.9, which do not support FP8, then the output that you get from scoring sequences with sensitive checkpoints may not be biologically meaningful.</p> <p>We plan on making a <code>1b</code> parameter evo2 checkpoint available soon that has been fine-tuned to be robust to FP8 or BF16 inference in bionemo on NGC, but in the meantime this notebook tutorial outlines the steps for fine-tuning. The only difference between this notebook and what we did in production was to run these steps on more data on a slurm cluster to increase the global batch size. That said, if you run this for enough steps to get loss on the 1b checkpoint to the 1.08 range, you should have good luck with downstream sequence scoring tasks.</p>"},{"location":"main/examples/bionemo-evo2/fine-tuning-tutorial/#requirements","title":"Requirements\u00b6","text":"<p>This is a tutorial demonstrating how you can fine-tune Evo2 on new data and/or hardware.

If you have multiple GPUs with less memory, or you are having trouble with CUDA OOM at the training step below, try reducing the <code>--micro-batch-size</code> and/or increasing the number of <code>--devices [int]</code> to match your setup and also setting <code>--tensor-parallel-size [int]</code> to the number of devices. This should split up most of the model evenly between your devices, which will require much less memory. When we train the 1b model in practice we typically have the micro batch size set to 8, and run without model parallelism on available devices to achieve the largest possible global batch size.</p>"},{"location":"main/examples/bionemo-evo2/fine-tuning-tutorial/#setup-training-data","title":"Setup training data\u00b6","text":"<p>Evo2 uses megatron style datasets behind the scenes with advanced support for randomly indexing into documents, and packing documents together into batches at scale.

This suggests bias in the model due to unbalanced data, however, further investigation is beyond the scope of this tutorial. Furthermore, we see continually improved performance as we move through the models, from baselines, to our provided pretrained model.</p> <p>Perhaps most interesting is the 106M parameter model, which clearly outperforms all other models by all metrics, but especially by F1-score.

The default and recommended version is the \"exact\" version, which is the default and can be toggled using the environment variable <code>CODON_FM_TE_IMPL=exact</code>.</li> </ol> Advanced: \"Non-exact\" TE Implementation (Optional)  We also present the ability to utilize a simpler model architecture that directly employs Transformer Engine's `TransformerLayer`. This implementation will not directly match the PyTorch (baseline) model (1) but it is simpler to use. To use it please set `export CODON_FM_TE_IMPL=nonexact`. Checkpoints cannot be converted from (1) to this model. This is more for educational purposes to show users the minimal code changes to lead to a TE-accelerated model. We verified that despite the slight architectural difference, this model converges on par with the original architecture.   <p></p> <p>The training step speedups for the 80M Encodon model when both Transformer Engine (TE) and Sequence Packing (THD) are applied compared to the Xformers based model are shown below. We benchmarked on NVIDIA H100 80GB HBM3 GPUs using a micro batch-size is 32. The training step speedups for the 1B Encodon model are on a micro batch-size of 4.</p> <p></p> <p>For inference we can also demonstrate acceleration when using each models TE counterpart. Thus, a 1.4X speedup in this chart shows how much faster the TE version of the model is over the original baseline PyTorch SDPA model. </p>"},{"location":"main/recipes/recipes/codonfm_ptl_te/codonfm_ptl_te/#quickstart","title":"Quickstart","text":"<p>To run the scripts in this repository, we recommend using the provided Docker setup.</p>"},{"location":"main/recipes/recipes/codonfm_ptl_te/codonfm_ptl_te/#1-clone-the-repository","title":"1.

When paired with Distributed Data Parallelism (DDP), the number of context parallel groups will be determined by <code>world_size//cp_size</code>.</p> <p>Thus, for example, if a user has 8 processes and sets <code>cp_size=2</code> they will have <code>2</code> CP groups and <code>4</code> DDP groups. During dataloading we make no assumptions about the data pipeline being deterministic or not. DDP groups will provide unique data while CP groups will contain replicates of that data.</p> <p>For example, let's say that we have 2 DDP groups and 2 CP groups. Each DDP group will have a unique dataloader DP0 for DDP group 0 and DP1 for DDP group 1. CP works by running something called ring attention, which expects tokens to live on each device in a particular layout. For this CP implementation we use something called Dual Chunk Swapping. If DP0 outputs sequence <code>1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8</code> and DP1 outputs <code>9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16</code> then when we run through the <code>CPAwareDataloader</code> defined in datasets, the dataloader will create CP shards from that DP group as follows:</p> <pre><code>      |   DP0   |    DP1        |\n  CP0 | 1,2,7,8 | 9, 10, 15, 16 |\n  CP1 | 3,4,5,6 | 11, 12, 13, 14|\n</code></pre> <p>You may notice these shards and wonder why they are the way they are. We did. The reason is that CP groups are sharded using slices. The full input sequence (such as <code>1 2 3 4 5 6 7</code>) is sliced into <code>2 * cp_size</code> groups. Then CP0 takes the first and last slice, while CP1 takes the middle slices, of each sequence.</p> <p>In this example we only show one sequence but its important to note that slicing takes place on every sequence, so if a second sequence is also available, that will be sliced in the same manner. CP0 will take the first and last slice of every sequence, while CP1 will take the middle slices of each sequence.</p>"},{"location":"main/recipes/recipes/esm2_native_te/esm2_native_te/#comparing-against-the-hf-transformers-reference-implementation","title":"Comparing Against the HF Transformers Reference Implementation","text":"<p>To launch training with the ESM-2 model as implemented in HF Transformers, pass a <code>facebook/esm2</code> checkpoint as the model tag:</p> <pre><code>python train_fsdp2.py --config-name L0_sanity model_tag=facebook/esm2_t6_8M_UR50D\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"main/recipes/recipes/esm2_native_te/esm2_native_te/#downloading-pre-training-data-for-offline-training","title":"Downloading Pre-Training Data For Offline Training","text":"<p>An example pre-training dataset for ESM-2 is available in the <code>nvidia/esm2_uniref_pretraining_data</code> Hugging Face dataset.

In its train/val/test_dataloader(), it creates the\n    WebLoader object chaining up the `pipeline_prebatch_wld` workflow.\n\n    Examples:\n    --------\n    1. create the data module with a directory of pickle files and the file name\n    prefix thereof for different splits to used by `Lightning.Trainer.fit()`\n\n    ```python\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; from bionemo.core.data.datamodule import Split, PickledDataWDS\n\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; dir_pickles = \"/path/to/my/pickles/dir\"\n\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; # the following will use `sample1.mydata.pt` and `sample2.mydata.pt` as the\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; # training dataset and `sample4.mydata.pt` and `sample5.mydata.pt` as the\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; # validation dataset\n\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; suffix_pickles = \"mydata.pt\"\n\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; names_subset = {\n    &gt;&gt;&gt;     Split.train: [sample1, sample2],\n    &gt;&gt;&gt;     Split.val: [sample4, sample5],\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; }\n\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; # the following setting will attempt to create at least 5 tar files in\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; # `/path/to/output/tars/dir/myshards-00000{0-5}.tar`\n\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; n_tars_wds = 5\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; prefix_tars_wds = \"myshards\"\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; output_dir_tar_files = {\n            Split.train : \"/path/to/output/tars/dir-train\",\n            Split.val : \"/path/to/output/tars/dir-val\",\n            Split.test : \"/path/to/output/tars/dir-test\",\n        }\n\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; # user can optionally customize the data processing routines and kwargs used\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; # in the WebDataset and WebLoader (see the examples in `WebDataModule`)\n\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; pipeline_wds = { Split.train: ... }\n\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; pipeline_prebatch_wld = { Split.train: ... }\n\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; kwargs_wds = { Split.train: ..., Split.val: ... }\n\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; kwargs_wld = { Split.train: ..., Split.val: ... }\n\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; invoke_wds = { Split.train: ..., Split.val: ... }\n\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; invoke_wld = { Split.train: ..., Split.val: ... }\n\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; # create the data module\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; data_module = PickledDataWDS(\n    &gt;&gt;&gt;     dir_pickles,\n    &gt;&gt;&gt;     names_subset,\n    &gt;&gt;&gt;     suffix_pickles, # `WebDataModule` args\n    &gt;&gt;&gt;     output_dir_tar_files, # `WebDataModule` args\n    &gt;&gt;&gt;     n_tars_wds=n_tars_wds,\n    &gt;&gt;&gt;     prefix_tars_wds=prefix_tars_wds, # `WebDataModule` kwargs\n    &gt;&gt;&gt;     pipeline_wds=pipeline_wds, # `WebDataModule` kwargs\n    &gt;&gt;&gt;     pipeline_prebatch_wld=pipelines_wdl_batch, # `WebDataModule` kwargs\n    &gt;&gt;&gt;     kwargs_wds=kwargs_wds, # `WebDataModule` kwargs\n    &gt;&gt;&gt;     kwargs_wld=kwargs_wld, # `WebDataModule` kwargs\n    &gt;&gt;&gt;     invoke_wds=invoke_wds, # `WebDataModule` kwargs\n    &gt;&gt;&gt;     invoke_wld=invoke_wld, # `WebDataModule` kwargs\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; )\n    ```\n    \"\"\"\n\n    def __init__(\n        self,\n        dir_pickles: str,\n        names_subset: Dict[Split, List[str]],\n        *args,\n        n_tars_wds: Optional[int] = None,\n        **kwargs,\n    ) -&gt; None:\n        \"\"\"Constructor.\n\n        Args:\n            dir_pickles: input directory of pickled data files\n            names_subset: list of filename prefix of\n                the data samples to be loaded in the dataset and dataloader for\n                each of the split\n            *args: arguments passed to the parent WebDataModule\n            n_tars_wds: attempt to create at least this number of\n                webdataset shards\n            **kwargs: arguments passed to the parent WebDataModule\n        \"\"\"\n        super().__init__(\n            *args,\n            **kwargs,\n        )\n\n        self._dir_pickles = dir_pickles\n\n        self._names_subset = names_subset\n\n        self._n_tars_wds = n_tars_wds\n\n    def prepare_data(self) -&gt; None:\n        \"\"\"This is called only by the main process by the Lightning workflow.\n\n        Do not rely on this data module object's state update here as there is no\n        way to communicate the state update to other subprocesses.

This included representative prokaryotic genomes available through GTDB release v214.1, and curated phage and plasmid sequences retrieved through IMG/VR and IMG/PR.</p> <p>Updated GTDB prokaryotic genomes Link: GTDB: an ongoing census of bacterial and archaeal diversity through a phylogenetically consistent, rank normalized and complete genome-based taxonomy Data Collection Method: Automatic/Sensors/Human Labeling Method by dataset: Automatic New prokaryotic reference genomes made available through the GTDB release 220.0 update were added to the training data for this study. New genomes were identified by selecting all species' reference genomes that had no previously published (release 214.1) genomes within their species cluster, resulting in 28,174 additional prokaryotic genomes.</p> <p>NCBI Eukaryotic reference genomes Link: Mash: fast genome and metagenome distance estimation using MinHash Data Collection Method: Automatic/Sensors/Human Labeling Method by dataset: Automatic All available eukaryotic reference genomes were downloaded from NCBI on 05/32/2024, excluding atypical genomes, metagenome-assembled genomes, and genomes from large multi-isolate projects. This resulted in 16,704 genomes including an estimated ~10.7 trillion nucleotides. Only contigs that were annotated as 'Primary Assembly', 'non-nuclear', or 'aGasCar1.hap1' (an aberrant annotation that applied only to GCA_027917425.1) were retained. Mash sketch was run on each individual genome with the flag \"-s 10000\" and the mash distance was calculated between all genomes as an estimate for their pairwise 1-ANI (average nucleotide identity). All genomes with a mash distance &lt; 0.01 were joined with edges in a graph, and clusters were identified by finding connected components. One representative genome per cluster was chosen, prioritizing genomes with a higher assembly level and genomes with longer total sequence length. This clustering resulted in 15,148 candidate genomes. Genomes were further filtered by removing ambiguous nucleotides at the termini of each contig, by removing regions annotated as \"centromere\" in an available GFF file, and by removing contigs that were less than 10 kb in total length. Finally, contigs that were composed of more than 5% ambiguous nucleotides were removed.

This included 41,253 metagenomes and metagenome-assembled genomes from NCBI, JGI IMG, MGnify, MG-RAST, Tara Oceans samples, and Youngblut et al. animal gut metagenomes. All contigs were split at consecutive stretches of ambiguous nucleotides of length 5 bp or longer, the split contigs were filtered by a minimum sequence length of 1 kb, and only contigs with at least one open reading frame as predicted by prodigal were kept. Contig-encoded proteins were previously clustered at 90% identity using MMseqs. To further remove redundant sequences, contigs were sorted by descending length, and each contig was only retained if at least 90% of its respective protein clusters were not already in the sequence collection (determined using a bloom filter).</p> <p>NCBI Organelle Link: NCBI Organelle Genome Data Package Data Collection Method: Automatic/Sensors/Human Labeling Method by dataset: Automatic Eukaryotic organelle genomes: (at the time of data query) 33,457 organelle genomes were identified and downloaded using the \"NCBI Organelle\" web resource. Ambiguous nucleotides at the terminal ends of the organelle genome sequences were removed. Sequences that had over 25 ambiguous nucleotides were removed.
